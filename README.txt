	Node.js
	Mongodb

2. Start the mongodb server by typing "mongosh" in the terminal.

5. Execute the code by opening three terminals, one for frontend, one for backend and one for database.

6. For database terminal, just make sure that the mongodb server is running by entering "mongosh"

7. For frontend terminal, execute the react js code by typing 'npm start'

8. For backend terminal, execute the python code by typing 'python app.py'

9. For now the code directly directs to dashboard page, we can change that in the website portal by taking off /dashboard and typing /login to navigate to navigation page. There are some bugs that we are facing for now. We will fix that by next patch

10. The code is available at https://github.com/ManeeshD07/SmartDataExplorer
